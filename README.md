IBM Data Analyst Capstone
I collected data from various sources such as job postings, training portals, and surveys using the Jobs API and web scraping. 
I then processed the data by removing duplicate values and imputing missing values, normalizing data, determining correlations, and removing outliers.
I queried the data with SQL to visualize relationships between features using charts and plots.
Finally, I presented technology usage and demographics by building an interactive dashboard using Cognos Analytics.
